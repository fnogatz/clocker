# clocker

track project hours

![clocker](clocker.png)

# example

To start tracking hours, just do `clocker start`:

```
$ clocker start -t BAZCORP
```

The `-t` is optional.

Some hours pass, then:

```
$ clocker stop
```

Run `clocker start` and `clocker stop` as you have more hours to track.

You can list the hours you've racked up with `clocker list`:

```
$ clocker list
1392707136  2014-02-17  [ 23:05:36 - 02:15:00 ]  (03:09:24)  [BAZCORP]
1392751800  2014-02-18  [ 11:30:00 - 16:20:00 ]  (04:50:00)  [BAZCORP]
1393020600  2014-02-21  [ 14:10:00 - 18:32:00 ]  (04:22:00)  [BAZCORP]
```

You can see a report of all logged hours of a specific day with `clocker report` command:

```
$ clocker report --day 2018-05-23
Report for 23 May 2018:
1527053106  2018-05-23  [ 07:25:06 - 08:09:25 ]  (00:44:19)  [TYPE_A]
1527056838  2018-05-23  [ 08:27:18 - 11:30:00 ]  (03:02:42)  [TYPE_B]
1527067800  2018-05-23  [ 11:30:00 - 11:58:18 ]  (00:28:18)  [TYPE_C]
1527073296  2018-05-23  [ 13:01:36 - 16:31:54 ]  (03:30:18)  [TYPE_B]

TYPE_A: 00:44:19
TYPE_B: 06:33:00
TYPE_C: 00:28:18

total: 07:45:37
```

Without the `--day` option, the report command will list all logged hours of the current day.

You can generate a json dump with `clocker data`:

```
$ clocker data BAZCORP --rate 125
[
  {
    "title": "consulting",
    "rate": 125,
    "hours": [
      {
        "date": "2014-02-18",
        "hours": 7.1
      },
      {
        "date": "2014-02-17",
        "hours": 0.9
      },
      {
        "date": "2014-02-21",
        "hours": 4.4
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This json output can be fed into [invoicer](https://npmjs.org/package/invoicer)
to generate a PDF invoice:

```
$ clocker data BAZCORP --rate 125 | invoicer -r BAZCORP -o invoice.pdf
```
